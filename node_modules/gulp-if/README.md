gulp-if
=======

Use boolean expressions or functions to conditionally control the flow of streams.


## Usage

```javascript
var gulpif = require('gulp-if');
var uglify = require('gulp-uglify');

var condition = true; // TODO: add business logic

gulp.task('task', function() {
  gulp.src('./src/*.js')
    .pipe(gulpif(condition, uglify()))
    .pipe(gulp.dest('./dist/'));
});
```

## API

### gulpif(condition, stream [, branch])

gulp-if will pipe data to `stream` appropriately whenever `condition` is satisfied.

To visualize stream flow, see the following diagram:

![](img/flow.png)

If `condition` is unsatisfied, then data from `stream A` will pass onto `Stream D`.

However, if `condition` is satisfied, then data from `stream A` will pipe to `stream B`.

If `branch` is true, `stream B` will not pass data to `stream D`. This is useful if another stream, say `stream C`, is connected to `stream B`. Otherwise, `stream B` will pass data to `stream D` whenever `branch` is false.

#### Parameters

##### condition

Type: `boolean` or [`stat`](http://nodejs.org/api/fs.html#fs_class_fs_stats) object or `function` that takes in a vinyl file and returns a boolean or `RegularExpression` that works on the `file.path`

The condition parameter is any of the conditions supported by [gulp-match](https://github.com/robrich/gulp-match).  The `file.path` is passed into `gulp-match`.

If a function is given, then the function is passed a vinyl `file`. The function should return a `boolean`.

##### stream

Stream for gulp-if to pipe data into. Useful when given a gulp-plugin.

##### branch

Type: `boolean`

Default: `false`

`branch` controls the flow behavior of whether gulp-if should pipe `stream` back to the main stream (i.e. branching flow).

If `true`, then gulp-if **will not** pipe `stream` back to the main stream. Otherwise, gulp-if will pipe `stream` back to the main stream.
